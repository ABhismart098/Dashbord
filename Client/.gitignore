.pnp.js
# Reason: These directories and files are generated during dependency installation and are not needed in version control. They can be restored by running `npm install` or `yarn install`.

# Testing coverage reports
/coverage
# Reason: Coverage reports are generated during testing and should not be included in version control. These are typically large files and can be recreated as needed.

# Production build output
/build
# Reason: The production build files are generated and should not be committed. These can be rebuilt using the build scripts.

# Operating system and IDE-specific files
.DS_Store
# Reason: MacOS creates .DS_Store files to store custom attributes of a folder. These are not relevant to the project.
.env.local
.env.development.local
.env.test.local
.env.production.local
# Reason: These environment files contain sensitive information (e.g., API keys, secrets) and are specific to individual environments.

# Debug logs
npm-debug.log*
yarn-debug.log*
yarn-error.log*
# Reason: Debug log files are generated during npm or yarn runs when errors occur. They are useful locally for debugging but should not be version controlled.
