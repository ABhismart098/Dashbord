# Environment files
.env
# Reason: Contains sensitive configuration details (e.g., API keys, database credentials) that should not be exposed publicly.

# Node.js dependencies
/node_modules
# Reason: These are large directories generated during dependency installation. They can be restored using `npm install` or `yarn install`.

# Logs
logs
*.log
npm-debug.log*
yarn-debug.log*
yarn-error.log*
# Reason: Logs generated during application runtime or debugging are not necessary to commit and may contain sensitive information.

# Build files
/build
/dist
# Reason: Build and distribution directories are output from the build process and should not be version controlled. They can be regenerated as needed.

# Temporary files
/tmp
/temp
# Reason: Temporary files generated during runtime or by the system should not be included in the repository.

# IDE-specific files
.vscode/
.idea/
# Reason: These contain IDE-specific configurations and are not relevant to the project source code.

# System files
.DS_Store
Thumbs.db
# Reason: These are OS-specific files and are not necessary for the project.

# Testing
/coverage
# Reason: Coverage reports generated during tests are large and should be excluded from version control.
